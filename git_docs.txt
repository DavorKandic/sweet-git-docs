##############################--- GIT DOCS ---#######################################

General:
--------
1) Git stores snapshots
=======================
When you commit, git stores snapshots of the entire file, 
it does not store diffs from the previous commit. 
As a repository grows, the object count grows exponentially 
and clearly it becomes inefficient to store the data as loose object files. 
Hence, git packs them and stores them as a . pack file.

2) Git Database
===============
At the core, git is nothing but a key-value data store. 
We can insert any kind of content into a Git repository and Git will hand us back a unique key 
we can later use to retrieve that content.
Git uses SHA-1 hash of the content (content could either refer a file or commit or directory structure) 
as the key and the content itself (compressed) acts as the value.

3) Git is a decentralized VCS 
=============================
— In a centralized VCS, the database resides on a central server and you checkout a copy from the server. 
Most of the commands require you to contact the central database and hence require network access. 
In a decentralized or distributed VCS, each and every node has a copy of the database 
and hence you clone a copy from a remote server. 
Note that the remote server has no special permissions except for the fact that all the nodes have access to the remote server. 
As a result of this, most of the commands on git (except git push or git pull) can be performed without network access.

4) Content of .git dir
======================
When you clone a git repository, it creates a .git folder at the root of the repository. 
This is where git stores all the data.

Contents of .git are:
The branches directory isn’t used by newer Git versions.
The description file is used to provide a name to the repository with the description and is only used by the Web UI.
The config file contains your project-specific configuration options
The info directory keeps a global exclude file for ignored patterns that you don’t want to track in a .gitignore file.
The hooks directory contains your client- or server-side hook scripts.
The index file is where Git stores your staging area information.

3 main components in this .git folder — 

Objects directory — The objects directory stores all the content of the git database.
Refs directory — The refs directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data.
Head file — The HEAD file points to the branch you currently have checked out.

5) 4 types of git objects
=========================
-commit
-tree
-blob
-annotated tag
